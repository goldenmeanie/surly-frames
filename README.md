Surly Frame Geometry
============
CSV of frame geometry for Surly bikes

I find it beyond my capacity to compare geometry between different frames using the charts on Surly’s site. I made a CSV of the data I was interested in for my own purposes and thought it might be useful to someone else too.

## Usage
This orientation is a bit less compact with the labels across the top, but I formatted it this way to make the frames available as records rather than the measurement type.

Load it into a spreadsheet and **freeze that left column**! Then you can hide everything but the couple frames your interested in.

## Why?
My LBS only stocks a couple of these frames and only in a couple sizes. This helps me extrapolate fit for different frames by comparing the numbers to frames that I am familiar with.

Now that I have a workflow I’ll probably go ahead and put all the bikes in there. But for the time being this only covers the 2014 versions of these few frames.

There is [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/buildium.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjcKyUe3m-FlcGRiNXJsTDFuczBYTHhNMzFXcHZrQ3c#gid=0) out there where folks are contributing personal metrics and fit info for the Long Haul Trucker to help you triangulate fit.
