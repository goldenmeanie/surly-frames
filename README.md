Surly Frame Geometry
============
CSV of frame geometry for Surly bikes

I find it beyond my capacity to compare geometry between different frames using the charts on Surly’s site. I made a CSV of the data I was interested in for my own purposes and thought it might be useful to someone else too.

Now that I have a workflow I’ll probably go ahead and put all the bikes in there. But for the time being this only covers the 2014 versions of the following frames.

#### 2014 Bikes
- Krampus
- Pugsley
- ECR

#### Why?
My LBS only stocks a couple of these frames and only in a couple sizes. This helps me extrapolate fit for different frames by comparing the numbers to frames that I am familiar with.
